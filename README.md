# Image Classification using TensorFlowLite on Raspberry Pi

A simple python script to demonstrate working of Image Classification on Raspberry Pi

## sample_pictures
This folder contains pictures of different objects/ animals. You can add more photographs of objects around you and test the script.

## model_files
This folder contains 03 different Pre-trained Models. All these models perform Image Classification and use a common label file. The label file conatain a list of 1000 objects. 
The Models are trained to classify these 1000 objects. The script uses one Model at a time to perform inference. You can change the Model in the script.

## requirements.sh
 pre-requisites i.e. Tensorflow Lite on Raspberry Pi using this bash script. Use the command 'sudo sh requirements.sh' in Terminal to install.

## I took the base Idea and made this detection system which can connect to any monitoring devices using IP address and also enable Communication of the systems via Internet
